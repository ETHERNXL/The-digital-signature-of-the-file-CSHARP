The digital signature of the file in C#
An electronic digital signature (or EDS for short) has the same legal status as a handwritten signature or seal.
EDS is data in electronic form, obtained as a result of cryptographic transformation,
which is added to other data or documents and ensures their integrity and identification of the author.
With the help of EDS services, you can sign electronic documents, use electronic services, register on state portals, etc.
Documents signed with the help of EDS have the same legal force as conventional ones.
As of the middle of 2018, about 9 million natural persons and representatives of legal entities already have EDS,
among them a third are natural persons, natural persons-entrepreneurs and self-employed persons.
An individual or a legal entity can receive EDS services at one of the Accredited Key Certification Centers (ACCS),
a full list of which is provided in the Electronic Register of entities that provide EDS-related services
